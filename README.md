# Predicting Diabetes Diagnosis from Health Indicators

## A distributed machine learning project that analyzes CDC behavioral risk data using Scala and MapReduce to predict diabetes diagnosis across three classes: Healthy, Prediabetic, and Diabetic.
ðŸ“Š Project Overview

## This project leverages a 253,680-instance dataset from the CDC to identify key health indicators correlated with diabetes diagnosis. We implemented a distributed Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier using Scala and MapReduce to process large-scale healthcare data and predict patient outcomes across three diagnostic classes. only want this in readme format for github with # and ##
